## 📊 Understanding the Reports

### Performance Metrics Glossary

| Metric | Description | Good Value |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **ns/op** | Nanoseconds per operation | Lower is better |
| **P50** | 50th percentile latency | < threshold |
| **P95** | 95th percentile latency | Most important metric |
| **P99** | 99th percentile latency | Worst-case performance |
| **QPS** | Queries per second | Higher is better |
| **allocs/op** | Allocations per operation | Lower is better |
| **B/op** | Bytes allocated per operation | Lower is better |

### Status Indicators

- **OK**: Within acceptable range
- 🚀 **IMPROVED**: Significant improvement (> 5%)
- ⚠️ **REGRESSION**: Performance degraded beyond threshold
- ➡️ **NO CHANGE**: Minimal difference (< 1%)

### Change Interpretation

| Change | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| -10% ns/op | 10% faster (good) |
| +10% ns/op | 10% slower (bad) |
| +10% QPS | 10% more throughput (good) |
| -10% QPS | 10% less throughput (bad) |

## 🎯 How to Use These Examples

### For New Users

1. Read `benchmark-output-example.txt` to understand raw output
2. Check `comparison-example.txt` to see regression detection
3. View `example-report.html` in browser for full experience

### For CI Integration

1. Reference `pr-comment-example.md` for expected PR comments
2. Use `example-report.json` structure for automation
3. Set up thresholds based on example values

### For Performance Optimization

## 🔍 Real vs Example Data

**Note:** These examples use realistic but fictional data. Your actual results will vary based on:

- Hardware (CPU, memory)
- Model sizes
- Batch sizes
- Concurrency levels
- Code changes

**To generate real reports:**

```bash
# Run benchmarks
make perf-bench-quick

# Compare with baseline
make perf-compare

# Generate reports
make perf-report
```
