# Context Management

This document defines how the harness exposes the minimum useful context for a task instead of forcing agents to read the entire `docs/agent/` tree.

## Why This Exists

- `AGENTS.md` should stay short and navigational.
- `docs/agent/*` should stay canonical, but the set is now large enough that agents need a task-first read path.
- `make agent-report ENV=cpu|amd CHANGED_FILES="..."` should resolve not only validation, but also the minimum context pack for the task.

## Disclosure Layers

- `L0` entrypoint
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/agent/README.md`
- `L1` task contract
  - resolved primary skill
  - fragment skills
  - the `## Must Read` links referenced by those skills
- `L2` surface context
  - only docs and executable sources for the impacted surfaces
- `L3` hotspot supplements
  - nearest local `AGENTS.md` files for changed hotspot trees
- `L4` durable loop context
  - execution plans, ADRs, and tech debt only when the task needs resumable or unresolved context

## Context Pack Flow

1. Resolve changed files through `make agent-report ENV=cpu|amd CHANGED_FILES="..."`.
2. Select the primary skill and fragment skills from `tools/agent/skill-registry.yaml`.
3. Pull the skill `## Must Read` references from the active `SKILL.md` files.
4. Add surface-specific references from `tools/agent/context-map.yaml`.
5. Add nearest local `AGENTS.md` files for hotspot paths when applicable.
6. Add resume references such as plans or debt only as low-priority follow-up context.

## Source of Truth

- Human-readable policy: this document and the linked harness docs under `docs/agent/`
- Executable map: `tools/agent/context-map.yaml`
- Skill-owned required reading: the active `SKILL.md` files under `tools/agent/skills/`
- Runtime assembly: `tools/agent/scripts/agent_context_pack.py`
- Validation: `make agent-validate`

## Maintenance Rules

- Do not duplicate full guidance into the context map; point to the canonical doc or executable file.
- Keep the context pack task-first and minimal; if a reference is almost always skipped, remove it or lower it to resume-only context.
- When a new surface, skill, or local rule is added, update the context map in the same change.
- If the context pack and the canonical docs disagree, fix the canonical doc and the executable map together.
