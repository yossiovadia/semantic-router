## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** (or Podman)
- **Make** (for build automation)
- **Python** 3.10+ (Optional: for training and testing)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router.git
   cd semantic-router
   ```

2. **Use the canonical local image workflow:**

   ```bash
   make vllm-sr-dev
   vllm-sr serve --image-pull-policy never
   ```

   For AMD ROCm development:

   ```bash
   make vllm-sr-dev VLLM_SR_PLATFORM=amd
   vllm-sr serve --image-pull-policy never --platform amd
   ```

   This workflow:
   - Rebuilds the local image
   - Installs the `vllm-sr` CLI tool
   - Uses the local image only, without pulling a remote fallback

3. **Install Python dependencies (Optional):**

   ```bash
   # For training and development
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For end-to-end testing
   pip install -r e2e/testing/requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Tests

### Agent Gates

The repository-specific agent harness is indexed in [docs/agent/README.md](docs/agent/README.md). Treat [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as the short entrypoint and `docs/agent/*` plus `tools/agent/*` as the durable source of truth.
If a real architecture or code/spec gap remains after your change, add or update the durable debt entry indexed from [docs/agent/tech-debt/README.md](docs/agent/tech-debt/README.md).

Read these first:

- [docs/agent/testing-strategy.md](docs/agent/testing-strategy.md)
- [docs/agent/module-boundaries.md](docs/agent/module-boundaries.md)

Use the agent-specific gates for changed files:

```bash
make agent-bootstrap
make agent-validate
make agent-scorecard
make agent-report ENV=cpu CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
make agent-ci-gate CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
make agent-feature-gate ENV=cpu CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
```

`ENV=amd` is required when platform-specific behavior changed.

### Unit Tests

1. **Test Rust bindings:**

   ```bash
   make test-binding
   ```

2. **Test Go semantic router:**

   ```bash
   make test-semantic-router
   ```

3. **Test individual classifiers:**

   ```bash
   make test-category-classifier
   make test-pii-classifier
   make test-jailbreak-classifier
   ```

### Manual Testing

Test different routing scenarios:

```bash
# Test model auto-selection
make test-auto-prompt-reasoning
make test-auto-prompt-no-reasoning

# Test PII detection
make test-pii

# Test prompt guard (jailbreak detection)
make test-prompt-guard

# Test tools auto-selection
make test-tools
```

### End-to-End Tests

Ensure both Envoy and the router are running, then:

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
python e2e/testing/run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test
python e2e/testing/00-client-request-test.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
python e2e/testing/run_all_tests.py --pattern "0*-*.py"

# Check if services are running
python e2e/testing/run_all_tests.py --check-only
```

The test suite includes:

- Basic client request tests
- Envoy ExtProc interaction tests
- Router classification tests
- Semantic cache tests
- Category-specific tests
- Metrics validation tests

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project structure and coding standards.

3. **Build and test:**

   ```bash
   make agent-report ENV=cpu CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
   make agent-ci-gate CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
   make agent-feature-gate ENV=cpu CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
   ```

4. **Run end-to-end tests:**

   ```bash
   make agent-e2e-affected CHANGED_FILES="path/one,path/two"
   # Or run a specific profile directly
   make e2e-test E2E_PROFILE=ai-gateway
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**

   Commit your changes with a clear message, making sure to **sign off** on your work using the `-s` flag. This is required by the project's **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**. The repository does not require commit messages to use the PR title classification prefixes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -s -m "clarify PR title guidance"
   ```

### Debugging

- **View logs:** Use `vllm-sr logs` to view service logs
- **Rust library:** Use `RUST_LOG=debug` environment variable for detailed Rust logs
- **Go library:** Use `SR_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable for detailed Go logs

## Code Style and Standards

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR, please run the pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. **These checks are mandatory** and will be automatically run on every commit once installed.

**Step 1: Install pre-commit tool**

```bash
# Using pip (recommended)
pip install pre-commit

# Or using conda
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit

# Or using homebrew (macOS)
brew install pre-commit
```

**Step 2: Install pre-commit hooks for this repository**

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run all checks
pre-commit run --all-files
# OR
make precommit-local
```

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- **Keep Go modules tidy:** Run `make check-go-mod-tidy` to verify all modules are tidy
- **Lint Go code:** Run `make go-lint` to check for issues, or `make go-lint-fix` to auto-fix

### Rust Code

- Follow Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Handle errors appropriately with `Result` types
- Document public APIs

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

## Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure all tests pass:**

   ```bash
   make test
   python e2e/testing/run_all_tests.py
   ```

   The `make test` command includes:
   - `go vet` for static analysis
   - `check-go-mod-tidy` for Go module dependency verification
   - Unit tests for all components

2. **Create a pull request** with:
   - A classified PR title using the repository prefixes from [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), such as `[Doc] Clarify PR title guidance` or `[Router][CI/Build] Tighten affected test selection`
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Test results and validation steps

3. **Address review feedback** promptly
